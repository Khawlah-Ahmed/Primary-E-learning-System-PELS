# Primary-E-learning-System-PELS-
This project pertains to a Primary E-learning System (PELS) that is developed for primary schools. PELS has been designed and developed to improve primary students learning activities and performance by exciting and motivating them by combining what they like (electronic devices) with learning and education in an attractive and interactive way. Improving the efficiency in which students learn is the most preferred need for each primary school. Therefore, the system would track the students’ performance so that their teachers and parents can evaluate and view statistics of their performance.   More specifically, the system will allow students to access materials and take quizzes and upon that, will be evaluated. The software will facilitate communication between students and teachers via E-mail (can be used for replying to students’ queries such as clarifying any ambiguous points in a course) or through a discussion board.
